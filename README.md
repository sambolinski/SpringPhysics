# Spring Physics Simulation
![img](https://i.imgur.com/PtxvkZT.png)
This project is a 2D pixel simulation of spring connections between nodes. The original goal was to simulate rope, which was achieved by connecting many nodes closely together. Properties such as tension and stretching can be shown, furthermore, if a few nodes are connected it also simulates soft-body physics.

# Features
- Physics
  - Spring physics based off equillebroium distance between nodes.
  - Force application such as gravity.
  - Toggle air resistance
- Interaction
  - Delect node to lock in position
  - Add to nodes and connect nodes together
  - Delete nodes 
- Graphics
  - Nodes can be drawn as circles or not drawn
  - Springs drawn as lines
  - GUI to show details such as number of nodes, whether the user is in edit mode.
